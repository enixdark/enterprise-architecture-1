### Overview

![](../.gitbook/assets/ea_process_strategic_planning.png)

### Process

 **Goal:** Articulate the desired future course of action for business and IT  
**Question:** How is the business environment changing and what should we do to react to these changes?  
**Focus:** Long-term and mid-term future  
**Instances:** Single, or several in highly decentralized organizations, e.g. one instance for each line of business

 **Nature:** Continuous and largely unstructured  
**Integration:** Integrated with regular strategic management activities, e.g. environmental analysis, identification of competitive advantages and goals formulation  
**Timing:** Aligned to the annual business planning cycle, important business dates, periods and events, e.g. fiscal years, budgeting cycles, board meetings or updates of a business strategy

 **Actors:** Business Leaders and Architects  
**EA Artifacts:** Considerations and Visions, e.g. Principles, Policies, Business Capability Models and Roadmaps \(see Enterprise Architecture on a Page\)  
**Other Documents:** Organizational mission and values, strategic goals, objectives and KPIs, balanced scorecards \(BSCs\) and strategy maps, business motivation models \(BMMs\), high-level strategic business plans and more detailed programs of work

 **Content:** Development of rules and directions for business and IT and their explicit documentation in Considerations and Visions  
**Activities:** Informal discussions, meetings, presentations and workshops, as well as periodical formal approvals and sign-offs  
**Techniques:** SWOT and PEST analyses, Five Forces and other strategy frameworks

 **Inputs:** Fundamental factors of the external business environment  
**Outputs:** High-level strategic plans for business and IT reflected in Considerations and Visions  
**Meaning:** Strategy-to-portfolio, i.e. convert an abstract business strategy into more specific suggestions regarding the desired portfolio of IT investments

* Which IT capabilities should be provided organization-wide?
* What IT-related policies should be complied with?

### Visions - Questions \(Architects\)
