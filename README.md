# Introduction

### Executive goals

As an Executive, imagine how your organization would work if you could help your organization to shape a common vision, to remove silos and to bridge business and IT, and to help strengthen the organization at a strategic level. Imagine a highly streamlined organization, with high effectiveness and efficiency. Imagine drastic cost reduction and increased profitability as well as market value. Imagine centralized compliance and high security. These are all the key goals of Enterprise Architecture.

### About the book

Our book is designed to help Executives transform their organizations through Enterprise Architecture to achieve excellent results - strategically, operationally and financially. Whilst there are many heavy-weight books regarding Enterprise Architecture, they sometimes go too deep into details and the big picture is forgotten - the essence of Enterprise Architecture. Here we hope to provide you with  the "essence" of Enterprise Architecture.

### About the author

Valentina is a proponent of standardization within software architecture and software development, and sees Enterprise Architecture as both creating business value by synergizing Business and IT and at the same acting as a cost optimizer through standardization.

### Acknowledgements

This book is based on the conceptual model of Enterprise Architecture CSVLOD. We are grateful to Svyatoslav Kotusev \([http://kotusev.com/](http://kotusev.com/)\) since we have used the ideas from his research, and we are grateful to him for providing the source architecture diagrams which were used for EA Artefacts and EA Practice in this book. We have chosen CSVLOD \(rather than TOGAF, Zachman\) because it is a pioneering systematic research-based model of established EA best practices based on industry research - a key differentiator in achieving successful EA.
