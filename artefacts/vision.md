* Based on the Maturity analysis, indicate the Gap level \(No Gap, Small Gap, Large Gap\)

Strategy Mapping:

* For each of the Sub-capabilities, mark the capability components \(P = Processes, S = Staff, I = Information, T = Technology\) with Strategic Priority \(Low, Medium, High\)
* Mark which Capabilities are core and which ones can be outsourced

Complex roadmaps:

* Goals
* Time \(Years\) including the planned yearly budget, and market for Now
* Initiatives:
  * Goals are linked to Initiatives
  * Initiatives are linked to Time to represent stat and end
  * There may be dependencies between dependencies \(e.g. an initiative to start after another initiative\)
  * Indicate the Budget level \(Small, Medium, Large\)
  * Indicate the Status \(Planned, Approved, Funded\)
* Current State:
  * Problems
  * Capabilities \(and Systems\)
* Future State:
  * Outcomes
  * Capabilities \(and Systems\)

Exotic roadmaps:

* Time: This Year, Next Year, futurre
* Business Divisions: Division 1, Division 2, Division 2
* Initiatives with the focus \(Applications, Information, Tools\) and short overview of the goals they attempt to achieve
