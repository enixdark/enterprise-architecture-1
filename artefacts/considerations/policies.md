# Policies

Overarching organizational norms typically of a restrictive nature providing compulsory prescriptions in certain areas

Policies prescribe norms, they are compulsory and restrictive, they are strict rules, where deviation from these rules is prohibited within the organization. This may include privacy policies, audit, data security policies, data exchange policies, cloud hosting policies. Policies are generally precise formulations of what "should not" be done. They are used by organizations which have sensitive data \(e.g. financial and personal data\) working in more regulated industries \(e.g. banking and healthcare\).
