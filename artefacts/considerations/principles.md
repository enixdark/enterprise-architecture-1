# Principles

Global high-level guidelines influencing all decision-making and planning in an organization

Principles are written high level guidelines which underpin decisions and enable Business Executives and IT architects to agree on the fundamentals. Principles define what is important for the organization, in a universal and abstract way. Principles outline, in an abstract way, what "should be" done.

### Example

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Principle</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Principle 1: Standardized Business Processes</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statement: Business processes should be standardized across all business
            units</li>
          <li>Rationale: Process standardization enables the company to work in a unified
            way to optimize global efficiency and reduce costs globally</li>
          <li>Implications: Process should be defined at a global level and supported
            by globally accessible applications used by all business units</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Principle 2: Single Customer View</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statement: Customer data should be shared between all business units</li>
          <li>Rationale: Customer data sharing enables unification and avoids duplication
            so that all business units have access to the single correct source of
            customer data, as well as enabling customer analytics</li>
          <li>Implications: Master version of customer data should be centralized and
            accessible to all business units</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Principle 3: Business Continuity</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statement: Critical business operations should never be interrupted, even
            in emergency cases</li>
          <li>Rationale: Uninterrupted 24/7 operations ensure a smooth and trusted customer
            experience</li>
          <li>Implications: Critical systems and databases should be geographically
            dispersed with replicas to ensure high system availability</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
