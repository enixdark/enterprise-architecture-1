# Standards

Standards are used to describe the goal technical rules, standards, guidelines, best practices and patterns enabling a proven reusable mechanism for solution implementation. They are developed as-necessary by architects and technical experts, and periodically updated. They help to achieve technical consistency and uniformity as well as regulatory compliance. They decrease the delivery time for IT initiatives, reduce the related costs, risks and complexity.

### Overview

 **Content:** Global technical rules, standards, patterns and best practices relevant to IT systems  
**Focus:** Do not focus on specific points in time or focus on the current state  
**Format:** Can be expressed in various formats, often using strict notations

 **Meaning:** Decisions on how all IT systems should be implemented and some facts on the current approaches and technologies  
**Usage:** Developed collaboratively by architects and technical subject-matter experts and used to shape the architectures of all IT initiatives \(see Enterprise Architecture Practice on a Page\)  
**Lifecycle:** Established on an as-necessary basis and updated according to the ongoing technology progress

 **Role:** Proven reusable means for IT systems implementation  
**Purpose:** Help achieve technical consistency, technological homogeneity and regulatory compliance  
**Benefits:** Faster initiative delivery, reduced costs, risks and complexity

* Data
  * IT Principle 3: Use Scalable Storage
  * IT Principle 4: Backup All Permanent Data
* Integration
  * IT Principle 5: Use Middleware for Integration
  * IT Principle 6: Avoid Binary Integration Protocols
* Infrastructure
  * IT Principle 7: Host in the Cloud
  * IT Principle 8: Dedicated Server for Each System
* Security
  * IT Principle 9: Place Public Systems in DMZ
  * IT Principle 10: Secure by Default

### Guidelines

IT-specific implementation-level prescriptions applicable in narrow technology-specific areas or domains

Provide implementation-level prescriptions in certain technology-specific or domain-specific areas, so that architects and subject matter experts can share and reuse best practices.

Guidelines have:

* Name
* Description

Examples of guidelines are for deployment, Networking, Data Encryption, Interface Design, Development.

Examples:

* Server Deployment Standards
  * Guideline 1: Run Applications as OS Services
  * Guideline 2: Store Deployment Packages in VCS
* Network Protocol Standards
  * Guideline 3: Avoid Using UDP Multicast
  * Guideline 4: Prefer REST Over SOAP
* Data Encryption Standards
  * Guideline 5: Use 256-Bit Encryption Keys
  * Guideline 6: Store MD5 Hashes of Passwords
* Interface Design Guidelines
  * Guideline 7: Use Web-Safe Colours
  * Guideline 8: Place Menu in the Top Right Corner
* Secure Coding Guidelines
  * Guideline 9: Initialize Variables to Safe Defaults
  * Guideline 10: Validate All Incoming Data

### Patterns

Generic reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in the design of IT systems
