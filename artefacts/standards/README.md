# Standards

Standards are used to describe the goal technical rules, standards, guidelines, best practices and patterns enabling a proven reusable mechanism for solution implementation. They are developed as-necessary by architects and technical experts, and periodically updated. They help to achieve technical consistency and uniformity as well as regulatory compliance. They decrease the delivery time for IT initiatives, reduce the related costs, risks and complexity.
