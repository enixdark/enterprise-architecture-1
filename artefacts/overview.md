# Overview

There are various popular Enterprise Architecture frameworks \(such as TOGAF\) which an extensive list of artefacts. They key problem is that they are often heavy-weight with significant documentation which is never read and becomes more of a formalistic burden, rather than providing value. We found the approach proposed by Svyatoslav Kotusev which maps CSVLOD taxonomy to artefacts a much more "proven" approach which is successful in practice.

The artefact taxonomy consists of:

* Considerations
* Standards
* Visions
* Landscapes
* Outlines
* Designs

In the following pages, we review the theory of the diagrams as well as providing practical examples.

### 

### What EA Artefacts Describe?

#### Rules

 **Describe:** General global rules defining an organization or its divisions  
**Scope:** Very broad, often relate to an entire organization  
**Format:** Often textual  
**Question:** How do we work or want to work?  
**Lifecycle:** Permanent, created once and then periodically updated  
**Role:** Basis for all other planning decisions  
**Purpose:** Help achieve consistency and homogeneity of all planning decisions

#### Structures

 **Describe:** High-level structures of an organization or its parts  
**Scope:** Broad, often cover large areas of an organization  
**Format:** Usually graphical  
**Question:** What approximately do we have or want to have?  
**Lifecycle:** Permanent, created once and then continuously updated  
**Role:** High-level “maps” facilitating decision-making  
**Purpose:** Help understand what changes are desirable and how to implement them

#### Changes

 **Describe:** Specific proposed incremental changes to an organization  
**Scope:** Narrow, limited to separate IT initiatives or projects  
**Format:** Mix of textual and graphical  
**Question:** What exactly are we going to change right now?  
**Lifecycle:** Temporary, created for specific purposes and then discarded  
**Role:** Tactical plans of an organization  
**Purpose:** Help plan separate changes in detail

### How EA Artefacts Describe?

#### Business-Focused

 **Language:** Technology-neutral business language  
**Domains:** Business domain and often other relevant domains at a high level  
**Format:** Brief, intuitive, largely informal and include only the most essential information  
**Stakeholders:** Business leaders and architects  
**Role:** Communication interfaces between business and IT  
**Purpose:** Help business leaders manage IT

#### IT-Focused

 **Language:** Technical IT-specific language  
**Domains:** Various technical domains and sometimes also business domain  
**Format:** Can be voluminous, formal, use strict notations and include comprehensive details  
**Stakeholders:** Architects and other IT specialists  
**Role:** Internal IT tools invisible to business  
**Purpose:** Help architects organize IT

### Taxonomy

#### Considerations

**Content:** Global conceptual rules and fundamental considerations important for business and relevant to IT  
**Focus:** Do not focus on specific points in time or focus on the long-term future  
**Format:** Expressed in simple intuitive formats, often as brief written statements

**Meaning:** Decisions on how an organization needs to work from the business and IT perspective  
**Usage:** Developed collaboratively by senior business leaders and architects and then used to influence all architectural decisions \(see Enterprise Architecture Practice on a Page\)  
**Lifecycle:** Established once and then updated according to the ongoing changes in the business environment

**Role:** Overarching organizational context for information systems planning  
**Purpose:** Help achieve the agreement on basic principles, values, directions and aims  
**Benefits:** Improved overall consistency between business and IT

#### Standards

 **Content:** Global technical rules, standards, patterns and best practices relevant to IT systems  
**Focus:** Do not focus on specific points in time or focus on the current state  
**Format:** Can be expressed in various formats, often using strict notations

 **Meaning:** Decisions on how all IT systems should be implemented and some facts on the current approaches and technologies  
**Usage:** Developed collaboratively by architects and technical subject-matter experts and used to shape the architectures of all IT initiatives \(see Enterprise Architecture Practice on a Page\)  
**Lifecycle:** Established on an as-necessary basis and updated according to the ongoing technology progress

 **Role:** Proven reusable means for IT systems implementation  
**Purpose:** Help achieve technical consistency, technological homogeneity and regulatory compliance  
**Benefits:** Faster initiative delivery, reduced costs, risks and complexity

#### Visions

 **Content:** High-level conceptual descriptions of an organization from the business perspective  
**Focus:** Often focus on the long-term future up to 3-5 years ahead  
**Format:** Expressed in brief informal formats, often as simple one-page diagrams

 **Meaning:** Decisions on what IT should deliver to an organization in the long run  
**Usage:** Developed collaboratively by senior business leaders and architects and then used to guide IT investments, identify, prioritize and launch new IT initiatives \(see Enterprise Architecture Practice on a Page\)  
**Lifecycle:** Created once and then updated according to the ongoing changes in strategic business priorities

 **Role:** Shared views of an organization and its future agreed by business and IT  
**Purpose:** Help achieve the alignment between IT investments and long-term business outcomes  
**Benefits:** Improved strategic effectiveness of IT investments

#### Landscapes

 **Content:** High-level technical descriptions of the organizational IT landscape  
**Focus:** Often focus on the current state  
**Format:** Expressed in strict formats, often as complex one-page diagrams using formal modeling notations, e.g. ArchiMate

 **Meaning:** Facts on the current IT landscape and some decisions on its future evolution  
**Usage:** Developed and maintained by architects and used to rationalize the IT landscape, manage the lifecycle of IT assets and plan new IT initiatives \(see Enterprise Architecture Practice on a Page\)  
**Lifecycle:** Created on an as-necessary basis and updated according to the ongoing evolution of the IT landscape

 **Role:** Knowledge base of reference materials on the IT landscape  
**Purpose:** Help understand, analyze and modify the structure of the IT landscape  
**Benefits:** Increased reuse and agility, reduced duplication and legacy



#### Outlines

 **Content:** High-level descriptions of separate IT initiatives understandable to business leaders  
**Focus:** Usually focus on the mid-term future up to 1-2 years ahead  
**Format:** Expressed as a mix of textual descriptions and simple diagrams

 **Meaning:** Decisions on how approximately specific IT initiatives should be implemented  
**Usage:** Developed collaboratively by architects and business leaders and then used to evaluate, approve and fund specific IT initiatives \(see Enterprise Architecture Practice on a Page\)  
**Lifecycle:** Produced at the early stages of IT initiatives to support decision-making and then archived

 **Role:** Benefit, time and price tags for proposed IT initiatives  
**Purpose:** Help estimate the overall business impact and value of proposed IT initiatives  
**Benefits:** Improved efficiency and ROI of IT investments





#### Designs

 **Content:** Detailed technical and functional descriptions of separate IT projects actionable for project teams
