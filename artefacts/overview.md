# Overview

There are various popular Enterprise Architecture frameworks \(such as TOGAF\) which an extensive list of artefacts. They key problem is that they are often heavy-weight with significant documentation which is never read and becomes more of a formalistic burden, rather than providing value. We found the approach proposed by Svyatoslav Kotusev which maps CSVLOD taxonomy to artefacts a much more "proven" approach which is successful in practice.

The artefact taxonomy consists of:

* Considerations
* Standards
* Visions
* Landscapes
* Outlines
* Designs

In the following pages, we review the theory of the diagrams as well as providing practical examples.
