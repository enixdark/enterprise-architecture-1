# Technology Optimization

### Overview

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ea_process_technology_optimization.png)

### Process

* **Goal:** Improve the overall quality of the corporate IT landscape
* **Question:** What is wrong with the current IT landscape and what should we do to improve it?
* **Focus:** Current situation with some future outlook
* **Instances:** Single, or several in highly decentralized organizations, e.g. one instance for each business division



* **Nature:** Continuous and largely unstructured
* **Integration:** Not integrated with any regular processes or activities
* **Timing:** May be carried out independently without any systematic schedule, often on an as-necessary basis or even opportunistically, e.g. in the absence of other higher-priority activities



* **Actors:** Architects alone
* **EA Artifacts:** Standards and Landscapes, e.g. Technology Reference Models, Guidelines, Landscape Diagrams and Inventories \(see Enterprise Architecture on a Page\)
* **Other Documents:** None

\*\*\*\*

* **Content:** Analysis of the existing IT landscape, update of Standards, maintenance of Landscapes and formulation of rationalization proposals
* **Activities:** Numerous informal discussions and periodical formal approvals
* **Techniques:** Total cost of ownership \(TCO\) and architecture debt management

\*\*\*\*

* **Inputs:** Current structure of the organizational IT landscape
* **Outputs:** Technical rationalization suggestions reflected in Standards and Landscapes
* **Meaning:** Structure-to-rationalization, i.e. understand the current structure of the IT landscape and formulate the rationalization strategy to guide its future evolution
