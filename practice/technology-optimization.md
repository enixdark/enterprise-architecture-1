# Technology Optimization

### Overview

![](../.gitbook/assets/ea_process_technology_optimization.png)

### Process

**Goal:** Improve the overall quality of the corporate IT landscape  
**Question:** What is wrong with the current IT landscape and what should we do to improve it?  
**Focus:** Current situation with some future outlook  
**Instances:** Single, or several in highly decentralized organizations, e.g. one instance for each business division

**Nature:** Continuous and largely unstructured  
**Integration:** Not integrated with any regular processes or activities  
**Timing:** May be carried out independently without any systematic schedule, often on an as-necessary basis or even opportunistically, e.g. in the absence of other higher-priority activities

**Actors:** Architects alone  
**EA Artifacts:** Standards and Landscapes, e.g. Technology Reference Models, Guidelines, Landscape Diagrams and Inventories \(see Enterprise Architecture on a Page\)  
**Other Documents:** None

**Content:** Analysis of the existing IT landscape, update of Standards, maintenance of Landscapes and formulation of rationalization proposals  
**Activities:** Numerous informal discussions and periodical formal approvals  
**Techniques:** Total cost of ownership \(TCO\) and architecture debt management

**Inputs:** Current structure of the organizational IT landscape  
**Outputs:** Technical rationalization suggestions reflected in Standards and Landscapes  
**Meaning:** Structure-to-rationalization, i.e. understand the current structure of the IT landscape and formulate the rationalization strategy to guide its future evolution

### Standards - Questions \(Architects\)

What technologies and vendor products are used?

What approaches and best practices are adopted?

Which technologies and products are redundant or duplicated?

Which technologies, products or approaches cause troubles?

Do the current technologies and approaches meet our needs?

### Landscapes - Questions \(Architects\)

What IT assets are maintained by our organization?

Which IT assets are barely used or provide similar functionality?

Which IT assets are no longer supported by their vendors?

Which IT assets may become problematic in the future?

Are the existing IT assets fit for our general business needs?
