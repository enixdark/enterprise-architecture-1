# Initiative Delivery

### Overview

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ea_process_initiative_delivery.png)

### Process

* **Goal:** Deliver optimal IT solutions for specific needs
* **Question:** What is the best way to address the requested need and all the associated requirements?
* **Focus:** Short-term and immediate future
* **Instances:** Multiple, one instance for each active IT initiative, e.g. project or program



* **Nature:** Sequential with two inherent steps: Initiation and Implementation
* **Integration:** Integrated with regular project and program management activities, e.g. scoping, estimating, scheduling, resourcing and monitoring
* **Timing:** Linked to the established initiative delivery phases and gates, e.g. scope, evaluate, plan, build, test and deploy



Step 1: Initiation

* **Actors:** Business Leaders and Architects
* **EA Artifacts:** Outlines, e.g. Solution Overviews and Options Assessments \(see Enterprise Architecture on a Page\)
* **Other Documents:** Business proposals and business cases



* **Content:** Analysis of possible solution implementation options, their explicit documentation in Outlines and official endorsement
* **Activities:** Frequent discussions, presentations and approvals
* **Techniques:** Business process modeling, customer journey mapping, return-on-investment \(ROI\) and architecture debt estimation

Step 2: Implementation

* **Actors:** Architects and Project Teams
* **EA Artifacts:** Designs, e.g. Solution Designs and Preliminary Solution Designs \(see Enterprise Architecture on a Page\)
* **Other Documents:** Business requirements and project management plans



* **Content:** Development of Designs based on Outlines and then their actual technical implementation
* **Activities:** Daily collaborative work
* **Techniques:** User stories, requirements traceability matrices and MoSCoW prioritization framework







* **Inputs:** Specific business, and sometimes technical, needs
* **Outputs:** New working IT solutions
* **Meaning:** Need-to-solution, i.e. convert a specific need into a concrete IT solution addressing this need in the most optimal manner
