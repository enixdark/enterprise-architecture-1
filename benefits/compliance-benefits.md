# Compliance Benefits

### Improved Regulatory Compliance

Enterprise Architecture enables organizations to adhere to regulations and to keep up with regulatory and legal changes through standardization and centralization.

### Improved Auditability

Enterprise Architecture helps organizations audit actions within systems and to trace events in a standardized way across systems.

### Reduced Security Risks

Modern organizations face serious challenges in security. In cases where security is not centrally determined, but is determined ad-hoc on a system-by-system basis, or is done inconsistently, it puts the organization in serious security risks. Enterprise Architecture enables organizations to have a blue print for security and data protection. This enables better protection of assets and maintaining customer trust by keeping their data secure.
